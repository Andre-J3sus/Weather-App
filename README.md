## Description

This is a weather app written in Python with the Tkinter module. 
The app communicates with the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API to retrieve the current weather information in a location and display it on screen.

To use it, just type in the name of a city and click on the "Search Weather" button. If the name is invalid, a message box is displayed.

The info displayed is:
- City and Country name;
- Weather description and icon;
- Temperatures (current, min and max);
